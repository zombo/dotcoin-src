Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run:
 bin/32/dotcoind (headless, 32-bit)
 bin/64/dotcoind (headless, 64-bit)

The software automatically finds other nodes to connect to.  You can
enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) with your router/firewall
or forward port 9901 (TCP) to your computer so you can receive
incoming connections.  DotCoin works without incoming connections,
but allowing incoming connections helps the DotCoin network.


Upgrade
-------
All you existing coins/transactions should be intact with the upgrade.
To upgrade from 0.2, first backup wallet
dotcoind backupwallet <destination_backup_file>
Then shutdown dotcoind by
dotcoind stop
Start up the new dotcoind (0.2.2).

Intro
-----
Dotcoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.
